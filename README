Audio-Visualiser---Audio-Metering
=================================



A starting point to begin with Audio Metering / audio visualisation.


Although, you would need to add an audio and use it though.

Go through the code, its quite simple.

And like always you are free to use this code in any way you want to. 

Please go through this awesome code by https://github.com/ChiefPilot/F3BarGauge
I have used it as my audio visualiser. 

If you find any bugs just let me know, also if you add any features do let me know. You can also commit
the code here and let us share it with the world.
